                <h1>The Double-Crested Cormorant Eating!</h1>
                <p> Food can be found in the sea, freshwater lakes, and rivers. Like all cormorants, the double-crested dives to find its prey. It mainly eats fish, but will 
                    sometimes also eat amphibians and crustaceans. Fish are caught by diving under water. Smaller fish may be eaten while the bird is still beneath the surface 
                    but bigger prey is often brought to the surface before it is eaten. Double-crested cormorants are also considered pests to aquaculturists because of their 
                    intense predation on fish ponds which can cause thousands of dollars in losses to farmers. Cormorants regurgitate pellets containing undigested parts of their
                     meals such as bones. These pellets can be dissected by biologists in order to discover what the birds ate.</p>

<h2> Physical Description</h2>
<p> The double-crested cormorant is a large waterbird with a stocky body, long neck, medium-sized tail, webbed feet, and a medium-sized hooked bill.
     It has a body length of between 70–90 cm (28–35 in) long, with a wingspan of between 114–123 cm (45–48 in).[7][9] Double-crested cormorants weigh 
     between 1.2–2.5 kg (2.6–5.5 lb). Males and females do not display sexual dimorphism.This species has dark-colored plumage with bare supra-loreal 
     skin and gular skin that is yellow or orange. 
 </p>
     
<p class="lead"> 
    An adult in breeding plumage will be mostly black with the back and coverts being a dark grayish 
     towards the center. Nuptial crests, for which the species is named, are either white, black or a mix of the two. These are located just above 
     the eyes with the bare skin on the face of a breeding adult being orange. A non-breeding adult will lack the crests and have more yellowish skin 
     around the face. The bill of the adult is dark-colored. 
</p>
<p>
    The double-crested cormorant is very similar in appearance to the larger great cormorant,
      which has a more restricted distribution in North America, mainly on the Canadian maritime provinces; it can, however, be separated by having more 
      yellow on the throat and the bill. The neotropic cormorant also looks very similar, and the two species can sometimes be found together where their 
      ranges meet.The plumage of juvenile double-crested cormorants is more dark gray or brownish. The underparts of a juvenile are lighter than the back 
      with a pale throat and breast that darkens towards the belly. As a bird ages, its plumage will grow darker. The bill of a juvenile will be mostly orange or yellowish.
</p>

<p>
          Breeding occurs in coastal areas as well as near inland rivers and lakes. They build stick nests in trees, on cliff edges, 
          or on the ground on suitable islands. They are gregarious birds usually found in colonies, often with other aquatic birds, 
          and have a deep, guttural grunt call.
</p>



            <h3> Distribution and habitat </h3>
            <p>   A very common and widespread species, it winters anywhere that is ice-free along both coasts, as far north as southern Alaska (on the west coast) and
                 southern New England (on the east coast). It can be found as far south as Mexico and the Bahamas. It migrates from the coldest parts of its breeding range,
                  such as eastern Canada, and has occurred in Europe as a very rare vagrant, for example in Great Britain, Ireland, and the Azores. It is resident on Pacific 
                  Coast from Aleutian Islands south to Nayarit, Mexico (but excluding parts of British Columbia and the Southern California Bight) and inland to the Colorado River, 
                  resident on Atlantic Coast in Long Island and surrounding areas, southern New England, Florida, Cuba, and Yucatán Peninsula Its breeding range extends north 
                  throughout most of north-central North America, from Utah north to Alberta east through the Great Lakes states to Nova Scotia, and south to northern Massachusetts, 
                  along with parts of Alaska adjoining Bristol and Kuskowim Bays. Its nonbreeding range extends throughout all coastal plains in the US, including the Atlantic and Gulf
                   Coastal Plains south to Campeche, as well as the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, and Cayman Islands, along with all areas previously stated to be resident. On the Pacific
                    Coast, range includes all areas previously mentioned to be resident, along with British Columbia and the Southern California Bight.</p>
