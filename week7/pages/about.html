							<p> We’re not the only ones who feel this way. There’s research to back it up and, more importantly, there’s a worldwide movement towards living mindfully. We’re doing what we can to inspire people to unplug and find some balance in their fast-paced digital lives.
							We tell stories and make thoughtfully designed pencils, notebooks, and tools. We champion small businesses. We support and promote independent artists through Blackwing Music. We develop and implement music and art education programs through the Blackwing Foundation.

We don’t expect you to throw out your tablet or stop streaming music. We just want to help you slow down a bit. We think you’ll feel better because of it.

We know we do.</p>

							<p> Our story starts with a pencil, but it doesn’t end there. We're a team of writers, artists, musicians, designers, and DIYers who think the world is a little bit better when you slow down.

We believe that thoughtful interaction with the world around us leads to a healthier life. That interaction may come from scribbling a thought in your journal, flipping through the dusty pages of a familiar book, or listening to the warm tone of your favorite record. No matter what form it takes, there's something profoundly human about it that's in our DNA.</p>

							<p> Legendary Grammy, Emmy, Pulitzer and Academy Award winners have created with the Blackwing 602 pencil. The list of known users includes John Steinbeck, Looney Tunes creator Chuck Jones, and Disney animator Shamus Culhane who, according to animation historian Charles Soloman, asked to be buried with his Blackwing 602.

Blackwing’s roots go back to the 1930’s when the 602 model was first introduced by the Eberhard Faber Pencil Company. Over the years, the pencil with the unique rectangular eraser became synonymous with quality. Then, in 1998, after several corporate acquisitions, it was discontinued, but not forgotten. In fact, fans began paying as much as $40 on eBay for a single Blackwing pencil.</p>

                            <h5 class="card-title">THE REVIVAL</h5>
							<p>In 2007, we introduced our Palomino range of pencils using Genuine Incense-cedar and premium Japanese graphite. Artists and writers started comparing them to their beloved Blackwing 602s, and folks began asking us to consider reviving the Blackwing brand. We tapped into over 100 years of family-run pencil industry experience to re-introduce Blackwing pencils in 2010.

In the 10 years since its revival, Blackwing has grown from a single pencil into a culture. It’s a culture that's all about living mindfully and finding balance in our fast paced lives. Click below to read more about how we're helping the world slow down.</p>
